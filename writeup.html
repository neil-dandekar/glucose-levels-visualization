        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Our team, The Avengers, chose to dive deeper into the
                <a
                    href="https://physionet.org/content/cgmacros/1.0.0/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >CGMacros Dataset</a
                >
                from the PhysioNet Databases. All three of us have a close
                relative or friend who has struggled with diabetes. Therefore,
                we felt compelled to make a visualization which allowed
                researchers to explore data more easily, which may help them
                make better and cheaper solutions for those with the disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                In particular, we explored how the daily average glucose level
                fluctuated throughout the 10-day period and across all 45
                participants in the study. Diabetes is a disease which affects
                glucose metabolism, therefore, analyzing glucose fluctuations
                over time was key to our visualization. Our goal is to answer
                questions regarding which factors may affect these fluctuations.
                with different diabetes status differs from one another
                throughout a 10 day study. Our take includes a bee swarm
                visualization, where each “bee” or blob represents an individual
                participant’s glucose level. Participants are also grouped by
                either non-diabetic, diabetic, or type 2 diabetic. We also
                incorporated a slider to view the data for each day of the
                study, with an option to animate the slider to loop through the
                day's automatically. In addition, The relative size of a blob
                represents the participant’s BMI and its shade of blue
                represents their microbiome gut health, where lighter blue is
                healthier. Overall, the chart is visually appealing, fluid, and
                easy to digest. Furthermore, it allows for easy analysis of the
                dataset.
            </p>

        <!-- Design Rationale -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
            <p>
                We considered multiple options originally. From line plots, to
                bar charts, to a visualization of the human body, we weren’t
                convinced that these would do the data justice. We wanted
                something more fluid as the goal was to make an interactive
                visualization.
            </p>
            <p>
                After researching online, we came across some example
                <a
                    href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/blog/chart-snapshot-beeswarm-plot/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >bee swarm charts</a
                >
                which we immediately started to play with. As the time series
                glucose data was the center of attention, we based the main axes
                around this data. Furthermore, it only made sense to use
                categorical data on the x-axis. We chose the patients’ diabetes
                status for the groupings because we assumed that trends within
                each group were most important for studying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another benefit to the bee swarm is the option to encode
                additional variables. For example, we used blob size and color
                to encode BMI and gut microbiome health. We decided that the
                visual size of a blob directly corresponds to a physical
                attribute like BMI which is, in a sense, related to the physical
                size of participants. We also wanted to indicate other health
                attributes about patients and realized that gut health may
                greatly affect one’s metabolism and glucose levels. Health is
                easy to categorize by color, so we chose a color encoding for
                this variable. We used a blue, monochromatic scale because it’s
                easy to interpret, and easy on the eyes. To help interpret these
                encodings, we used visual size scales for the BMI size legend
                and color labels for the gut health. With multiple displayed
                sizes for the BMI chart, the user is able to more easily
                interpret the blob sizes. However, to view exact data, as well
                as more attributes about individual participants (age, gender,
                etc.), users can hover over blobs for a tooltip of info.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps our most interactive element is the slider. The time
                series portion of this data was key and we loved the idea of
                being able to animate our visualization to display trends over
                time. Since time is a linear scale, we thought of a horizontal
                slider for the user to select different days of the study to
                display. Additionally, we added an “Animate” button to bring the
                data to life and automatically move throughout time. This
                utilized JavaScript’s <code>setInterval()</code> function that
                animated the Day Slider in a continuous loop, and could be
                stopped at the user’s discretion. By stopping at discrete days,
                users can make more in-depth observations for each day, and by
                animating, the user can get a better sense of the fluctuation
                trends over time. To make the blobs more fluid, we used the D3
                force library to make the blobs bounce around and slide between
                each other.

            <h2>Development Process and Time Allocation</h2>
            <p>
                Initially, our group met in person to brainstorm datasets to
                visualize, which charts to use, and ultimately settled on our
                design choices. We also did some introductory Exploratory Data
                Analysis (EDA) on a single computer together to draft some
                initial plots and ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Idhant spliced together some of the different csv files in the
                database to create a combined overview of data, including stats
                about each participant, in addition to the glucose data. Neil
                used python scripts to concatenate, clean, and merge all 45
                individual participant files into one large dataset, which was
                also grouped by individual day in the study and the mean glucose
                level was recorded as separate columns to be displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of us were new to D3.js so it took some time getting
                familiar with. We spent some time also reviewing the
                documentation and watching YouTube videos to get a grasp.
            </p>
            <p>
                As time went on, we distributed the programming tasks in
                parallel. After initializing a GitHub repository, each of us
                created our own branches to work on separate features. We
                developed the chart entirely in D3, combining HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript to combine the design, content, layout, and
                interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the tasks and time were split as followed (total: ~26
                hours):
